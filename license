r4t is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

This means that you can use r4t with both open-source and proprietary software.
The only requirement is that when you distribute your program you have to make the source of epublib available (putting a link in your documentation is fine) and if you modify r4t (bug-fixes, new features, etc) you must also make these available.
You do not have to make the source code of your application available.
